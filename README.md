## What does this mod do?
This mod stops Minecraft from interrupting music when you switch worlds, or go back to title screen.

## Known bugs
- Every sound keeps playing when you leave a server not only music (Which is hard to notice)

## Future plans:
- Save music state when they are stopped and resume them manually
  (To fix other sounds from resuming too)
- Add a ClothConfig options for manual music delay, disabling the mod
- Add a config option to disable region specific music

(I don't garantee that I will do all of these)
